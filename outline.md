- What is "metadata" in the context of telecommunications data-retention?
  - What, who, why, when?
  - Broad outline: 'information or documents about the communication, but not the content or substance of those communications'

  - Complexity and breadth of the story presents a storytelling challenge
    - Outlets covering since beginning, very little cut through: a communications challenge
    - A concrete and startling example

  - Our approach
    - Independent investigation
    - Demonstrate via audience participation

- Why are journalists particularly affected?
  - Are we even special?
  - Exposing corruption & wrongdoing is difficult and risky

- Audience interaction and results
  - Hundreds of responses
  - Frightening accuracy; frightening inaccuracy
  - Still a serious level of misunderstanding
